## Managing your team project backlog

In this exercise, you are going to examine the various portfolio
planning features of Visual Studio to group and manage your work and
that of your team using backlogs. This exercise assumes you have
completed Exercise 1, and have created a Team Project using the Scrum
template with a Git repo.

> Watch the [video overview](https://youtu.be/x4csUGcF4LI )

This exercise uses a team project named **jdev** (if you have chosen a
different name for your project, select the project you created in the
previous exercise). For this first part, you will create work items for
you in the lab. Later, you will create some more work items as you work
through the MyShuttle scenario.

1.  Login to your VSTS account and navigate to your project

2.  Click the **Work** link.

3.  On the left, click the **Features** link.

    formatting.

    in the list to open up the dialog

    assigned to you automatically because the parent feature was
    assigned to you.

    You can now see any of the child tasks associated with the PBI.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image15.png" width="370" height="71" />

    You can also see parent items (in the case Features).

1.  On the command bar above the backlog, click the Hide link to the
    right of the Parents label to “show” the parent Features.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image16.png" width="513" height="37" />

    You now can see the Parent Features.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image17.png" width="468" height="219" />

1.  Under the Backlog items title, click the Board link.

     <img src="./images/backlog/image18.png" width="146" height="55" />

1.  In the Committed column, on the only card, click the
    <img src="./images/backlog/image19.png" width="43" height="32" /> item.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image20.png" width="170" height="175" />

    You can see the child task here.

1.  Click the **+ Add task** item.

2.  In the open text area, type **Add master navigation to menu page**
    and press **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Enter</span>**.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image21.png" width="167" height="210" />

    You can see all of your work for the active sprint by accessing the
**Task Board**.

1.  On the left, click **Sprint 1** under **Current**.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image22.png" width="152" height="200" />

    Now you can see your work for the just the current sprint.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image23.png" width="279" height="173" />

    You need to assign the **Add master navigation to menu page** Task to you.

1.  Move your mouse and hover over the card and you’ll get a combo-box
    that opens up.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image24.png" width="254" height="139" />

1.  Assign the task to yourself.

    One more thing you need to do is add an estimate for each work item.

2.  In the task board mouse over at the bottom right corner of the task card and enter the value **1**. This is nothing but **Remaining Work** field , you can also open the work item and then update **Remaining Work** field value and save the changes. Repeat this for another task in task board.
    
    <img src="./images/backlog/image25.png" width="335" height="123" />

    Now you want to show that you’ve started working.

    progress** column.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image26.png" width="335" height="123" />

1.  In the upper right corner of the Task board, click the **Settings**
    icon

    <img src="./images/backlog/image27.png" width="226" height="27" />

    This opens the Settings dialog where you can make adjustments to many
    features of the Work Hub including the Task board.

1.  For **Task** check the **Show ID** checkbox to show the work item ID
    on the cards.

    <img src="./images/backlog/image28.png" width="240" height="90" />

1.  Click **Save and Close** when done.

    Now you’ll be able to see the Work Item ID easily when you look at
    the Task board. You’ll use the IDs later when you commit code to
    your Git repo in the next exercise.
