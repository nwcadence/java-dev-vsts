## Working with Git

In this exercise, you are going to learn how to put some existing code
into your Team Project. This exercise assumes you have completed
Exercise 1, and have created a Team Project that uses Git for version
control and have completed Exercise 2 where you’ve defined some work
items. This exercise uses a team project named **jdev**, though your
team project name may differ.

Adding existing code to Git
---------------------------

1.  Connect to the virtual machine with the user credentials which you have given while creating the virtual machine in azure portal.
2.  Once connected ,open Eclipse from the Launcher by clicking on the **Eclipse** icon.

3.  When the **Workspace Launcher** appears, you can accept the default
    folder or select another one. This is where Eclipse will store
    your projects. You can select the **Use this as the default and do
    not ask again** option if you want Eclipse to remember the folder
    and do not prompt every time on startup.

    Select **OK** when you are done.

    **user.email** in the **Key** field and in the **Value** field,
    enter your *e-mail address* and click **OK**.

    <img src="./images/git/image29.png" width="813" height="645" />

4.  Click **OK** to save your preferences.

<pre>You’re now ready to take your local changes and commit them locally and then push them up to 
your remote repository in Visual Studio Team Services.</pre>

Committing changes to Git
-------------------------

1.  In the **Project Explorer**, right click on the root node and select
    **Team | Commit**. You can alternatively press **CTRL+\#** key

    <img src="./images/git/image30.png" width="909" height="638" />

1.  In the **Commit Changes** dialog, enter a commit message like **Add
    existing files** followed by \#123 where 123 is the Work Item ID
    for one of your PBIs. If you don’t remember the Work Item ID,
    switch over to your open web browser and take a look at the
    Backlog or Task Board.

2.  In the Files section click the
    <img src="./images/git/image31.png" width="19" height="24" /> button to
    select all the files.

3.  Now click **Commit and Push**.

    <img src="./images/git/image32.png" width="695" height="718" />

1.  Once the process is complete, click **OK** to close the **Push
    Results** dialog.

     <img src="./images/git/image33.png" width="653" height="452" />

    Let’s see what you can see using the Visual Studio Team Services
    website for the project. Switch back to your web browser.

2.  Click the **Code** link at the top. You can see the code you just
    pushed into the repository.

    <img src="./images/git/image34.png" width="610" height="495" />

1.  Click the **History** tab to see the information on the push you
    just performed.

2.  Click the **Explorer** link, and then expand the **src** folder
    under the **jdev** root until you find the **DataAccess.java**
    file (jdev/src/main/java/com/microsoft/example). Select that file.

    <img src="./images/git/image35.png" width="764" height="453" />

1.  You can easily browse the file. As you can see Visual Studio Team
    Services understands that this is a particular type of file and
    applies syntax formatting.

2.  Select the root **jdev** node.

3.  Leave your browser open and on the current page. Continue to the
    next exercise [**Running builds, Unit Tests and Code Coverage**](./4.Running builds, Unit Tests and Code Coverage.md) where you’ll configure a Team Build.
