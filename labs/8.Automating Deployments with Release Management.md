# Releasing your applications  

A big pain for any development team is getting changes made on a
developer’s workstation deployed to a dev, test, or even production
environment. Release Management makes it easy to take the results of a
successful Team Build and deploy them to one or more environments.

Release Management is a service in Visual Studio Team Services and Team
Foundation Server (update 2 and later) that helps you automate the
deployment and testing of your software in multiple environments. Using
Release Management, you can either fully automate the delivery of your
software all the way to production, or set up semi-automated processes
with approvals and on-demand deployments. It is an essential element of
DevOps that helps your team continuously deliver software to your
customers at a faster pace and with lower risk.

Before you start to write your release definition, you will need to
install the **Tomcat** extension. When you install the extension, it
adds a Build/Release task for deploying a WAR file to Apache Tomcat
Server.

Adding Tomcat Extension
-----------------------

1.  From your Team Services account, go to the **marketplace**

    <img src="./images/rm/image0.png" width="194" height="145" /> 
   
   or go to   <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/#VSTS>

2.  In the search box type **Apache Tomcat** then click search button   
      
    <img src="./images/rm/image2.png" width="639" height="435" /> 
    

3.  Select the extension titled **Apache Tomcat Deployment**   
      
    <img src="./images/rm/image3.png" width="369" height="295" />

4.  Select **Install** on the Extension home page  
      
    <img src="./images/rm/image4.png" width="531" height="248" />

5.  In the resulting page, click the Account field to select the account
    name where you want to install the extension  
    <img src="./images/rm/image5.png" width="340" height="264" />

6.  Select **Confirm**. Once the extension is installed, you can close
    the page and navigate back to your VSTS project

Creating a new release definition
---------------------------------

1.  In VSTS, access the **Build** Hub of your Team Project. Select the
    **Manual Build** and queue a new build.

    `If you want to skip the tests, you can specify -Dmaven.test.skip=true in the `**Options**` parameter of `**Maven**` buld task`
    
    <img src="./images/rm/image0a.png" width="817" height="240" />

1.  When the build is complete, ensure that the build has generated and
    published the WAR file. You can verify this by select the build
    and then selecting the **Artifacts** tab. Click the **Explore**
    link next to the folder **Site**. Expand the folder and you should
    see **MyShuttleDev.war**

    <img src="./images/rm/image6.png" width="868" height="304" />

    We are now ready to release the WAR file to the Tomcat server
    running on the VM. To begin this, select the **Release** hub.

2.  Click the **+New Definition** button to start creating a
    Release Definition.

    <img src="./images/rm/image7.png" width="460" height="258" />

3.  Choose the **Empty** definition and click **Next**.

    <img src="./images/rm/image8.png" width="503" height="413" />

4.  In the **Create new release definition** wizard select **Mannual Build** as source definition and **Default** agent queue for         Queue, then click on **Create** button.

    <img src="./images/rm/image8a.png" width="503" height="413" />

5.  Click on  <img src="./images/rm/image8b.png" width="26" height="22" /> icon and change the name to **MyShuttle Release.**

    <img src="./images/rm/image8c.png" width="427" height="152" />

6.  Click **Add Tasks** and choose **Deploy to** **Apache Tomcat** task
    from the group and click **Add**.

    <img src="./images/rm/image9.png" width="521" height="467" />

7.  Click **Close**.

8.  Edit the **Tomcat** task parameters to match the
    > following settings:
    
    | **Setting**           | **Value**                                                             |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Tomcat Server URL     | http://localhost:8080                                                 |
    | Username              | vmadmin                                                               |
    | Password              | $(VM\_PWD)                                                            |
    | WAR File              | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\\Manual Build/site/myshuttledev.war |
    | Application Context   | /myshuttledev                                                         |
    | Tomcat Server Version | 7 or above                                                            |

        
    
    <img src="./images/rm/image11.png" width="890" height="292" />

9.  Let’s define the variable we used in the task. Select
    **Configuration** and enter **VM\_PWD** as the name for the
    variable and **P2ssword** as the value. Select the little lock
    icon next to the value field to hide the variable so that it is
    not displayed as plain text.

    <img src="./images/rm/image12.png" width="902" height="213" />

10.  Now, let’s go back to the **Environments** tab. Select the **Environment1**
     and click the ellipsis button and select **Agent Queue**.

    <img src="./images/rm/image13.png" width="391" height="462" />

11.  Select the **Default** pool (that has the local build agent running
    on the VM) as the default queue

    <img src="./images/rm/image14.png" width="653" height="405" />

    `You may also assign approvers for post and pre deployment to the environments but since we are deploying to a development environment,we will assume that no approval is required and leave it as automated.`

Triggering a release
--------------------

You can specify how deployment should be triggered for each environment.
For example, you can set up a linear pipeline where a release is
deployed first to the **Dev** environment, then to the **QA**
environment and finally, if the deployment to **QA** succeeds, to the
**Prod** environment. Alternatively, you can set up a release process
where a build is deployed to a number of **QA** environments in parallel
as soon as it completes, but the release to the **Prod** environment
must always be deployed manually by selecting a successful release and
promoting it.

1.  Select the **Environment1** and click the ellipsis button and select **Deployment Conditions**.

    <img src="./images/rm/image15.png" width="369" height="367" />

2.  Select **After release creation** for **Triggers** and click **OK**
    to close the dialog

    <img src="./images/rm/image16.png" width="647" height="474" />

3.  Select the **Save** button to save the new release definition.
    Select **Release** and **Create Release**

    <img src="./images/rm/image17.png" width="347" height="254" />

4.  Select the latest build from the Artifacts Version dropdown and
    select **Create**

    <img src="./images/rm/image18.png" width="607" height="416" />

    Wait for the release to be completed. When the release is
    successful, we should have the latest version of the application
    with a new UI look running on tomcat. Open Firefox in the VM and
    navigate to the page **http://localhost:8080/myshuttledev**
